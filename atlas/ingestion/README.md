# Atlas Ingestion

This folder governs how raw discipline data enters Atlas.

Key principles:
- Ingestion is strict by design.
- Atlas does not generate partial briefs.
- Instructional minutes are required for value and credibility.
- If data cannot support the full Decision Brief, ingestion halts.

`SKILL.md` is authoritative.  
Code must implement the skill exactly as written.
